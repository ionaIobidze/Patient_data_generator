# Patient Data Generator

This project focuses on generating synthetic healthcare data that mimics real-world patient data. The generated data is useful for tasks like anonymization, counterfactual simulations, and filling in missing data.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses healthcare data.
- **Model Development:** Uses machine learning models to generate synthetic data.
- **Counterfactual Simulations:** Allows for “what-if” scenario analysis.
- **Anonymization:** Ensures data privacy with differential privacy techniques.
